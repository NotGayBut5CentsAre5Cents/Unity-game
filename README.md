The game is finished
there is a small bug that does not let me to build it for pc.
It works perfectly for android.
If you want to test it on pc you will need to test an older version or in the unity editor.
The path for the scenes is  C:\Users\*Your User*\Desktop\Archive-a418\Archive-a418\MLG FLAPPY BURD FAPPING MACHINE - FOR JOEL\MLG FLAPPY BURD FAPPING MACHINE - FOR JOEL\MLG FLAPPY BURD FAPPING MACHINE - FOR JOEL\Assets\MyShit\Scenes\MainMenu.unity
